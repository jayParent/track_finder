          Have you ever found a new song that you just cannot get enough of? You listen to it over and over for a few
          days or weeks. This song feels perfect to you. You wonder how it’s possible for a song to be this good. No
          matter how amazing this song is, you’re not going to listen to it all day on repeat. You hop on Spotify.
          Wanting more of this feeling, you select this song and choose the option “Go to Song Radio” and start
          listening, hoping to find a different song that makes you feel the way you felt when you heard this other
          track. More often than not, in my experience at least, you will be left very disappointed. The playlist you
          receive will probably have other songs from that artist, songs of the same genre from other artists. Many of
          these songs however will have vastly different tempo, energy, have much more or less vocals and convey a very
          different mood or feel overall. This is the problem I’m trying to fix with this app.
        </p>
        <p>Spotify keeps data on every track they have. Some of this data is what they call “Audio Features”. The audio
          features are: acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, liveness, loudness, speechiness, valence
          and tempo. Every song has a value for each of these features and they are publicly available to developers. By
          having access to these features, you will hopefully be able to identify which of them play a more important
          role in your musical taste. You may then set target and maximum values for the features you chose, allowing
          you to target much more accurately the tracks you receive as recommendations.
